# TrafficFlowObserved.dateObserved

## Definition
The date and time of this observation in ISO8601 UTC format. It can be represented by an specific time instant or by an ISO8601 interval. As a workaround for the lack of support of Orion Context Broker for datetime intervals, it can be used two separate attributes: `dateObservedFrom`, `dateObservedTo`. [DateTime](https://schema.org/DateTime) or an ISO8601 interval represented as [Text](https://schema.org/Text)
